#Long Short-Tem Memory networks
These are type of recurrent neural netwoeks that achives state-of-the-art results on challenging predictions problems.

Sequence prediction is different to other types of supervised learning problems. The sequence imposes an order on the 
observations that must be preserved when training models and making predictions.
